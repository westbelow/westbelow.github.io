# About Me:

I am a Computer Scientist, Data Analyst and published author that grew up in California, United States but has since taken refuge in the fine state of Tennessee. 

I received an associate of sciences degree in Natural Sciences from Santa Rosa Junior College, and then a Bachelor of Science degree from Tennessee Technological University. During my senior year, I successfully helped design, implement, and deploy productivity software for NAVSEA, a subsection of the United States Navy, and wrote an analysis and report for Putnam County School District. 

I have been published in multiple prestigious publications, including The Puma Prensa, the Press Democrat, and the Iris Review. "<p>Note: these writings do not necessarily represent my current opinions on political and social issues</p>"
