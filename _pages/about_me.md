# About Me:

I am a Computer Scientist, Data Analyst and published author that grew up in California, United States but has since taken refuge in the fine state of Tennessee. 

I received an Associate of Sciences degree in Natural Sciences from Santa Rosa Junior College, and then earned Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Tennessee Technological University. During my senior year, I successfully helped design, implement, and deploy productivity software for NAVSEA, the largest systems command branch of the United States Navy. I also performed a comprehensive risk-assessment analysis for Putnam County School District, the findings from which is actively being used for strategic intervention, support, and encouragement of the more than 12,000 students within their jurisdiction across four towns and cities. 

I have been published in multiple award-winning publications, including The Puma Prensa, the Press Democrat, and the TN tech Iris Review (Note: these writings do not necessarily represent my current opinions on political and social issues).
