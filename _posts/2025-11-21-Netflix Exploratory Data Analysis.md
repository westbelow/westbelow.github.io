title: "Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis - Findings"
---


The exploratory analysis of the Netflix dataset reveals several notable trends in the platform’s content strategy. First, monthly release counts appear to be relatively steady throughout the year, though a mild seasonal pattern emerges: July sees the highest volume of new content added, while February sees the lowest.

In terms of format distribution, the data shows a clear imbalance — Netflix releases roughly two movies for every one TV show, suggesting a strong emphasis on expanding its film library. Netflix's emphasis on movies over television is surprising, considering much of their more influential Originals (think Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Wednesday, Stranger Things, Peaky Blinders) are shows, not movies, though it's worth noting the data in this set seems to be limited through 2021. 

A year-over-year breakdown highlights a consistent upward trajectory in total content additions. This annual increase in releases may reflect efforts to justify rising subscription prices by offering a larger and more diverse catalog.

Finally, genre analysis demonstrates that drama and comedy dominate across both movies and TV shows, making them the most prominent categories on the platform. This aligns with broader viewer demand trends and underscores Netflix’s focus on delivering widely appealing content.
