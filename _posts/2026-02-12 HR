title: "HR Health Bonus Dashboard"
---

I have created an end-to-end SQL dashboard based on a dataset of absentee data for employees. 

The following specifications were given:

1.) Provide a list of employees that are healthy and have low absenteeism
2.) Calculate a wage increase for non-smokers from a budget of $983,221
3.) Create a dashboard for HR to understand absenteeism at work based on an approved wireframe. 

For the first part, I used SQL to provide a count of employees that were healthiest. The criteria I used to define "healthy" were those that were not smokers, did not drink alcohol, have a body mass index (BMI) of below the national average of 25, and had a below average absentee hour time.

For the wage increase, it was a simple matter of dividing the dollar amount given from the budget by the amount of employees that are classified as non-smokers. The employees who don't smoke will get an additional $1414.40 a year in compensation. 

After that, I created a dashboard using powerBI to visually represent the issue.
